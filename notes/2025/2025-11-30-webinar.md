# Runes Capsule Webinar

**Date:** Nov 30, 2025, 5:00 PM  
**Host:** Rapha RSierra  
**Language:** English (Global)

## General Summary

- **Capsule Security Advantage:** Capsule bridge offers 10x security by isolating assets in multisig capsules, preventing theft without user signature.

- **Trustless Peg-in Process:** Peg-in is fully governed by code; peg-out requires user approval via a multisig signer set for withdrawals.

- **User Control Mechanism:** Users can customize signer configurations, ensuring sovereignty over tokens and reducing single points of failure.

- **Future Protocol Developments:** Upcoming Beefy Swap will enable peer-to-peer trustless swaps for different tokens, enhancing trading capabilities on L2.

- **Technical Dependencies:** System relies on Stacks network for token minting, with varying trust levels between peg-in and peg-out processes.

- **Strategic Ecosystem Impact:** Capsule aims to improve bridging standards, enhance user security, and unlock benefits of L2 solutions in the ecosystem.

## Notes

### Bridge Security and Token Sovereignty

The meeting confirmed that the Capsule bridge offers a **10x security improvement** over typical bridges by isolating each user's assets in individual multisig capsules, eliminating the centralized honeypot risk and preventing theft without the user's explicit signature _(02:38)_.

- Unlike traditional bridges, where a compromised multisig can steal all assets and mint unlimited tokens, Capsule requires each user's signature for withdrawals, making theft practically impossible without user collusion.

- The system mints tokens on L2 only after trustless verification of L1 Bitcoin transactions via Clarity code, removing ambiguity and operator privilege during deposits.

- A fail-safe mechanism flags and halts suspicious large withdrawals by slowing them down and disabling minting privileges, limiting damage from potential bribery or collusion.

- This design aligns with the mission to remove admin control and exploit vulnerabilities seen in bridges like Wormhole, ensuring long-term asset sovereignty and preventing pump-and-dump schemes.

### Peg-in and Peg-out Process and Trust Model

The peg-in process is fully governed by code and trustless, while peg-out requires a multisig signer set plus the user's mandatory signature, creating a trust-minimized but not fully trustless withdrawal mechanism _(23:53)_.

- Depositing runes to Capsule uses Clarity's ability to read and verify Bitcoin transactions on L1, minting one-to-one L2 tokens without relying on any specific operator or oracle.

- Peg-out requires a collaborative multisig signer set plus the user's signature to authorize withdrawals from each user's isolated capsule, preventing unauthorized asset transfers.

- Even if signers collude, they cannot withdraw without the user's signature, making bribery and collusion economically unviable and reputationally damaging.

- The peg-out design balances security with usability, accepting current Bitcoin protocol limitations that prevent fully trustless write-back to L1.

### Decentralized Signer Federation and User Control

Each user's capsule operates under an **M-of-N multisig** where the user's signature is mandatory; users may have flexibility in choosing the number of signers required, trading off between security and liveness _(34:13)_.

- Hero and Rapha discussed potential signer configurations, such as "user plus X signers," allowing users to select thresholds like 2-of-3 or 5-of-8, with the user always required to sign.

- This architecture prevents single points of failure and ensures users maintain sovereignty over their tokens even if some signers are unavailable or compromised.

- The idea of adding extra signatures for recovery or multi-sig with family members was acknowledged, enhancing security and usability.

- The signer federation is in active discussion with potential partners, with emphasis on decentralized and independent signers to preserve trust and prevent collusion.

### Market Dynamics and Future Protocol Extensions

Currently, users can only withdraw back to L1 tokens they initially deposited, but Rapha plans to enable peer-to-peer trustless swaps allowing withdrawals of different tokens from those originally bridged _(56:05)_.

- The future system, called **Beefy Swap**, will match users wanting to withdraw tokens they did not originally lock on L1, using Clarity-governed smart contracts without additional signatures or oracles.

- This extension supports fungible token trading and arbitrage between L1 and L2 while maintaining security guarantees.

- This is viewed as critical for large holders, arbitrageurs, and broker-dealers, aligning with the vision of a secure and sovereign multi-asset ecosystem.

- The trade-off remains between convenience and security, with security prioritized to ensure longevity and user trust.

---

### Technical and Network Considerations

The system depends on the Stacks network and Clarity smart contracts to verify Bitcoin transactions and mint tokens, relying on network availability but minimizing trust in individual operators _(16:00)_.

- Peg-in does not require federated operators since anyone can submit and verify Bitcoin transactions using Merkle proofs via Clarity contracts.

- Peg-out requires federated signers plus the user signature to execute multisig withdrawals from the user's capsule on L1.

- While the system is highly trust-minimized, it depends on the Stacks network's continued operation, recognized as a limitation for full trustlessness.

- Potential censorship risks at the block producer level were acknowledged, but historically neither Bitcoin nor Stacks have demonstrated censoring transactions in practice.

- The architecture separates peg-in (trustless, code-driven) and peg-out (signer-dependent) processes, with a design that can evolve as Bitcoin and Layer 2 technologies mature.

### Strategic Implications and Ecosystem Impact

Capsule's architecture aims to raise the standard for bridging runes, benefiting the entire ecosystem by enabling sovereign, secure, and long-lasting L2 solutions _(01:24:00)_.

- The bridge design addresses user skepticism caused by past multi-hundred-million-dollar hacks in the bridging space.

- By removing centralized control and honeypots, Capsule targets sophisticated users who understand Bitcoin transactions and value security over convenience.

- Collaboration with community partners and beta testers is emphasized to refine the protocol, aiming to upgrade the bridging standard for runes on Stacks.

- The solution is positioned as a foundational step toward a more secure multi-chain ecosystem, reducing exploit risks while unlocking L2 benefits like cheaper, faster swaps and lending.
