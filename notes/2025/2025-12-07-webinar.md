## Runes Capsule Bridge and Security

> The main outcome is the launch of Runes Capsule, a trustless bridge that removes human risk in bridging tokens from Bitcoin L1 to Stacks L2.

- Demonstrated a **multisig capsule wallet** requiring user signatures to secure withdrawals, ensuring users control asset movement
- Uses **Clarity smart contracts as an oracle** to parse Bitcoin transactions and mint equivalent tokens on Stacks without manual intervention
- Eliminates dependency on federations prone to hacks or freezes — a major pain point in current bridges
- Withdrawal process back to Bitcoin requires **decentralized signers who cannot move funds without explicit user approval**
- Architecture aims to sustain long-term use aligned with Bitcoin's longevity, addressing key market trust issues

## Product Strategy and User Benefits on Stacks L2

> Core strategy focuses on delivering fast, cheap, and secure trading on Stacks L2 as a superior alternative to Bitcoin L1.

- **5-second settlement times** on Stacks vs Bitcoin's typical 10-minute confirmation
- **Concentrated liquidity pools** improve price precision and reduce slippage, outperforming legacy AMMs like Uniswap V2
- Users gain **programmability and interoperability benefits**, enabling new use cases beyond trading
- Trustless design means users don't rely on federations to determine token minting amounts
- Targets holders valuing both liquidity and strong security — Stacks as complementary to Bitcoin storage, not a replacement

---

## Liquidity Bootstrapping and Market Positioning

> Key business decision: use Faktory Launchpad pre-launch mechanism to bootstrap liquidity and filter quality projects.

- Pre-launch holders must **vest tokens for 4 weeks**, preventing pump-and-dump schemes and sniper attacks
- Only 2 projects have passed this vetting so far, indicating system selectivity
- Post pre-launch, projects can graduate to:
  - Uniswap V2 pools
  - Concentrated liquidity pools
- Multiple liquidity provision options including **single-sided pools**:
  - Communities provide Bitcoin liquidity
  - Founders supply token side
  - Diamond hands earn bonuses
- Strategy attracts serious communities by reducing noise and scam risk

---

## Community Engagement and Incentives

> A competitive grant program offering $1,500 in sBTC yield to the community partner with the most nominations.

- Nominations limited to **3 per wallet** to prevent abuse
- Plans include evolving to a **two-round voting system** to identify top projects
- Feedback from Mark Kilaghbian, DeOrganized, and Reubs emphasized:
  - Focus messaging on user benefits rather than security details for broader appeal
- Grant incentivizes Rune communities to explore Stacks L2
- Leaderboard and voting system creates visibility and competition
- Deadline timing linked to participation levels to maximize impact

---

## Technical Infrastructure and Future Development

> Platform integrates seamlessly with existing wallets like Leather and Xverse.

- Bridge encodes **user Stacks addresses into Bitcoin transactions** to guarantee accurate token minting and ownership mapping
- Fully governed by code with no oracle or human input
- **Future upgrades:**
  - Concentrated liquidity on pre-launch pools
  - Formal audits with established Stacks companies
  - Credit card purchases via Intent Message Protocol + Shopify
- Fun use cases being explored (ordering real-world goods with tokens) to showcase programmability

---

## Strategic Vision and Market Differentiation

> Runes Capsule positioned as a long-term, secure upgrade to existing bridges focused on user sovereignty and censorship resistance.

- Bridging to Stacks **complements Bitcoin** by offering fast trading and composability without sacrificing security
- Counters extractive business models seen on Solana (sniping, pump schemes) — aims for sustainable value creation
- **Runes assets are more interoperable than SIP-10 tokens:**
  - Already listed on Solana
  - Available on centralized exchanges
  - Supports multi-chain expansion
- Philosophy: meet users where they are while providing layered options for security, liquidity, and utility
- Committed to building infrastructure that can last as long as Bitcoin itself
